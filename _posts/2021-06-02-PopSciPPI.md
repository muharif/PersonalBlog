Last Saturday (May 29th, 2021), I presented on one of [my project](https://blog.muharif.net/WhatIsHappeningHeartAttack/) at Popular Science Conference #1 organized by Indonesian Student Association in Sweden.

It was a fun event to participate in! It's hard to present in Indonesian language plus that it has to be presented in "popular science" style, which has to be understandable by non-expert. 

I will definitely join for more presentations like this and will try to write more popular science style in this blog. So stay tuned!
